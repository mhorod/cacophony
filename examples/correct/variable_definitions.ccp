# Basic data types

let bool_false: Bool = false;
let bool_true: Bool = true;

let ten: Int = 10;

let empty: Unit = ();

let fn = [] -> Unit => ();

# Automatic type inference

let two = 2;
let four = two + two;

let result = fn[];

# Multiple definitions

let three = 3, four = 4;

# Uninitialized variables
